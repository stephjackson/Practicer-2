Practicer is a utility for musicians to design practice sessions and exercises and keep track of the BPM they can play exercises at over time.

# How does it work?

In Practicer, users can create practice schedules and fill them with individual exercises. Individual exercises are assigned a time and BPM value, and can be given to multiple lists.

During practice, you can either click "Nailed It!" or "No Luck!". Nailed It registers that you've completed an exercise and increases the BPM by 1, while No Luck registers that you've completed it but reduces the BPM by 10%.

In the exercises view, a user can click "details" to show the stats for a given exercise. Here, a table of each session is shown, along with a graph that shows progression over time.
